1. A Database Management System (DBMS) consists of several key components that work together to manage data efficiently.The components of a DBMS include: Hardware-The physical devices used to store and process data.  Software-The actual DBMS software that manages the database.Provides an interface between users and the database.  Data - The raw facts and figures stored in the database.Database Engine-The core component responsible for storing, retrieving, and processing data.Ensures transactions follow ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability). Query Processor -Translates user queries into actions.Optimizes and executes SQL commands efficiently. Transaction Management -Ensures data integrity and consistency.Handles multiple user requests without conflicts.
A Relational Database is a type of database that stores data in tables (rows & columns) and establishes relationships between them using keys (Primary & Foreign Keys). It follows Structured Query Language (SQL) for data management.Examples are MySQL,PostgreSQL,Oracle Database,Microsoft SQL Server .
DML (Data Manipulation Language)-Deals with manipulating data within the database.DDL (Data Definition Language)-Defines and manages database structures (tables, views, etc.).DCL (Data Control Language)-Deals with permissions and access control to the database.
A primary key uniquely defines a record within its own table, while a foreign key is used to connect and maintain relationships between records in different tables.
An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of the entities (objects or things) in a database and their relationships. It helps design and structure databases by showing how data entities interact with one another.
Data Integrity-Enforces consistency and accuracy through constraints (e.g., Primary Key, Foreign Key).Data Redundancy Reduction-Organizes data in separate tables, minimizing duplication.Flexibility-Allows for complex queries using SQL and easy retrieval of related data from different tables.Scalability-Can handle large amounts of data and is easily scalable as the system grows.Security -Provides access control with user permissions and data protection mechanisms.

The purpose of a DBMS is to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently and securely. It serves as an interface between users and the database, ensuring data integrity, security, and accessibility.
